Purpose
=======

This requirements specification is intended to be read by source code
contributors to guide the development of an open science gateway for
the Psychological Sciences.

Scope
=====

A working title for this project is "Synapse".

With relative ease, Synapse will allow users to:

* Share data with collaborators
* Transfer data between storage systems
* Manipulate files on storage systems
* Define sharable, reusable analytical applications
* Launch and monitor computing jobs on research computing clusters
* Maintain metadata (descriptive, structural, administrative, provenance, etc.)
  for research data
* Produce visualizations
* Publish datasets with persistent identifiers

In the interest of limiting scope, Synapse will not offer:

* Computational capabilities outside of those provided by computing clusters to
  which users already have access.
* TODO: add more limitations.

Offering these features in an easy-to-use package will save users time
by automating tasks which they would otherwise do manually.
