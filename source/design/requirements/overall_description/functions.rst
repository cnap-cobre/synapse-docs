Product Functions
=================

TODO - A summary of the major functions that the software will perform.
Should be understandable to the user or anyone reading this for the
firsttime.  Graphical methods can help show functions and relationships.
Diagrams should not show design but rather logical relationships among
variables.

Describes the functionality of the system in the language of the customer.
What does the system have to do?  Again, a description of what the system
needs to do, not how it will be built.  Requirements, not design.
