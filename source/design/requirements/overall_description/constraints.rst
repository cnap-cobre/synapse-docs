Constraints
===========

TODO - A general description of things that will limit the developer's options.
Potentially including:

* Regulatory policies (HIPPA)
* Hardware limitations
* Browser versions
* Interfaces to other applications
* Parallelism
* Handshake protocols (have to have some server-side pages for OAuth to work)
* Reliability (this is in their critical path)
* How critical the application is
* Safety and security

These are non-functional requirements which are presented in the customer's
language.
