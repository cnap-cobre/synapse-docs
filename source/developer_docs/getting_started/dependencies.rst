Dependencies
############

You will need to install:

* Git
* Docker https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/
* Docker Compose https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/

For linux environments, you may want to add yourself to the docker
group so that you don't have to use sudo to run docker or docker-compose.

``sudo usermod -aG docker $USER``

Windows
-------

If you use Windows, you have my condolances.

For Windows 10 Professional or Enterprise 64-bit, use
`Docker for Windows <https://www.docker.com/docker-windows>`_.  These versions
of Windows has the visualization support Docker needs.

For any other version of Windows, get
`Docker Toolbox <https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/overview/>`_.  This will
install VirtualBox, and your Docker containers will run inside of a Linux VM.

Alternatively, you may choose to spin up a Linux VM and run your containers
inside of it directly.


Mac
---

Docker for Mac requires OS X El Capitan 10.11 or newer with Intel hardware
support for MMU virtualization (2010 or newer).  If your system does not
satisfy these requirements, you can install Docker Toolbox or simply spin up a
VM and then run Docker inside of that.
