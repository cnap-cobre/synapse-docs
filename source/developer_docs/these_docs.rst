Building these Docs
===================

To make building these Docs easy, we use yet another Docker container.

Go to the ``docs/`` directory and run:

``docker-compose up``

You can now view the docs at ``http://localhost:2999/`` in your browser.

Note: You will need Docker installed as well as Docker Compose.  See details
on this in :ref:`dependencies`.
